  <h1>Centralized electronic health record systems</h1>

  <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
  <p>Many healthcare providers in New Zealand continue to rely on legacy electronic health record (EHR) systems.
     These outdated databases were not designed for modern healthcare demands and often result in data duplication,
     corruption, and inefficiencies. The consequences are significant: compromised data integrity, increased risk of
     medical errors, and delays in clinical decision-making.</p>

  <p>This project investigates the impact of outdated EHR databases on patient care, focusing on risks such as
     inconsistent or corrupted entries. It also explores opportunities for improvement through modernisation,
     interoperability, and advanced data management. Finally, it critically assesses the choices available to
     healthcare providers, from maintaining legacy systems to full replacement, highlighting the ethical and
     practical implications of each.</p>
