  <h1>Choices for Healthcare Providers TEST</h1>

  <h2>Maintain Legacy Systems</h2>
  <p>Lower short-term cost but perpetuates risks of errors, inefficiencies, and breaches (Ratwani, 2018).</p>
  <p>The first option is to continue operating on the existing legacy systems with little to no change other than the occasional maintenance to ensure the systems remain functional. This option comes with its positives and negatives. The first positive is there would be little to no additional costs other than maintenance and upkeep of such old systems. Another positive is healthcare workers would require no extra training or grace period for a transition from one system to another. There are numerous reasons why healthcare providers might choose this first option. This option is typically the go to as a temporary solution to a long term issue whilst a plan is set in motion for long term fix such as option two, three or four with this option hardly ever being a permanent choice.</p>

  <h2>Incremental Upgrades</h2>
  <p>Improves functionality but risks creating fragmented "patchwork" systems that may not communicate effectively (Khairat et al., 2020).</p>
  <p>The second option is slow incremental upgrades instead of a full transition in one foul swoop. This option provides healthcare workers with time to learn the new systems being implemented and provides a grace period for a safer and swifter transition. The upfront cost requirements are lower than a full transition to modern systems however the overall price is likely going to be relatively similar to a full replacement in the long run. The glaring issue with this option is the possibility of creating what is known as a “frankenstein” system. This results in potential compatibility and integration issues. The possibility for parts of the system to slip through the gaps and remain unupdated is also a real issue. Human error is inevitable and the possibility that sections are missed is not zero. Another risk is slow performance from bottlenecking due to a frankensteined system. This option is commonly the go to when budget or time constraints make a full system overhaul unrealistic or infeasible. </p>

  <h2>Full Replacement</h2>
  <p>Provides the greatest long-term benefit in terms of interoperability, safety, and efficiency but requires major investment and organisational change (Raitoharju et al., 2025).</p>
  <p>The third option is a full complete overhaul and implementation of a modern interoperable EHR system. This option maximises long term benefits however requires a significant upfront cost and requires a large amount of time for healthcare workers to fully transition and become accustomed with the new system which could lead to further costs and potentially put patients at risk. The long term benefits are quite substantial however. Significant improvements to efficiency as well as Improved patient care, faster system speeds and the potential for greatly reduced maintenance as well a significant improvement to security to list a few. These long term benefits are quite enticing however the large upfront cost of a massive system overhaul is a limiting factor and often why this choice is overlooked. Migration of data is a significant concern with this choice as well considering how old legacy systems can be and are often not compatible with newer systems for data transfers resulting in the requirement for manual conversion of data from legacy to modern. </p>

  <h2>Hybrid Approach</h2>
  <p>Critical systems are modernised first, while non-critical components remain on legacy infrastructure - balancing cost with patient safety (Raitoharju et al., 2025).</p>
  <p>The fourth and final option is a hybrid approach. This option is similar to the incremental approach however the critical modules are migrated first whilst keeping the non-critical legacy components until they are ready to be transitioned. This is an important difference between this option and incremental implementation as this approach balances both cost and risk whilst not tipping the scale on either and allows for the benefits of the incremental implementation. This not only lowers the risk posed to healthcare workers and patients but allows for a clear roadmap in order to prevent the risk of creating a Frankenstein system. Potential issues could arise from running both a legacy and modern system side by side but if closely monitored any issues should be swiftly resolved if any arise. This option is largely considered as the most efficient and cost effective choice and subsequently the one that is most commonly chosen due to the low risk and lower upfront cost compared to two of the three other choices. </p>
