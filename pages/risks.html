 <h1>Risks and Challenges of Legacy EHRs</h1>

  <h2>Financial Costs</h2>
  <p>Implementing and transitioning from legacy EHR systems to any new systems incur both 
    financial and operational cost and can be quite costly especially when dealing with larger systems.
     The costs incurred not only include the cost of acquiring and implementing the new system, 
     but also supporting and legacy systems until all data has been transitioned to the new system <a href="references.html">(Huang et al., 2020)</a>.<br>
Hospitals that rely on several systems present an extra challenge both in terms of the difficulty of migration
 and cost as each legacy system must be supported and transferred during the duration of the migration <a href="references.html">(Huang et al., 2020)</a>. 
</p>

  <h2>Data Security and Privacy</h2>
  <p>The move to a standardized and more centralized EHR creates personal data security concerns. 
    The larger scale of a centralized EHR system increases the potential size and impact of a data breach. 
    The sensitivity of this data aids in intensifying the impact of any personal information being leaked, 
    as this highly detailed and private data is used to target vulnerable people for blackmail or identity theft <a href="references.html">(Foster et al., 2019)</a>.   </p>

  <h2>Data Migration Issues</h2>
  <p>When implementing a new system the data contained within the legacy system will often have to be converted to a compatible form then migrated to the new system. 
    This can be done either be done via manual abstraction or electronic conversion <a href="references.html">(Posircaru, 2015)</a>.
     Both of these methods have their own benefits and risks.......</p>

  <h2>Workflow Disruption</h2>
  <p>The efficacy of any system introduced in organization relies heavily on the staff that are using the system to be properly trained and proficient with said system. 
    However due to several limiting factors getting a full array of staff efficiently trained can be problematic, 
    for example a case study <a href="references.html">(Kalkatawi, 2025)</a>.
    found getting attendance of the entirety of a hospitals staff for training difficult due to a large 
    amount of medical students and residents working in said hospital changing frequently,
    requiring ongoing sessions of training to ensure the maximum amount of staff were 
    proficient with the hospitals systems. 
    Ensuring this is paramount as to avoid excess errors and downtime  <a href="references.html">(Kalkatawi, 2025)</a>.
